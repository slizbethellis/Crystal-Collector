# Crystal Collector
The user is given a random number at the start of the round. Each of the four crystals gets a new random value each round. Clicking on a crystal adds to that round's score.

If the user's score matches the target number, the user wins. If the score exceeds the target number, then the user loses that round.

The value of each crystal is hidden, and the user must determine the value of each crystal by watching the score change.
